                    salvage whatever was
                    edible from paddy she had stored earlier.

                    Her home in Chhatak upazila's Bashkala village washed away in the flood shortly after she had moved
                    to a shelter centre.
                    Meanwhile, her paddy rotted in the floodwaters.</p>
